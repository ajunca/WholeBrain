# This is a form of standardizing Observable result. It holds a dictionary "_data" with its results values in it.
# Different Observables can derive from it and then define properties for easy access.
# For example:
#   class FooObservableResult(ObservableResult):
#       def __init__(self):
#           super().__init__('Foo')
#       @property
#       def value1(self):
#           return self._data['value1']

# Abstract class for Observables. At the moment it has a main method "from_fmri" that takes the signal and the filter
# as parameters and outputs the result if computable (or None if some problem occurred). Each implementation has to
# define "_compute_from_fmri" method.
#
# NOTE: At the moment every Observable subclass outputs its own result format, so maybe at a future we have to
# standardize it somehow...
#
# MORE NOTES: Maybe it should be called ObservableOperator as it operates on signals and spits the result but is not
# itself and Observable(?). Also note that the implementation is as this to maximize the portability with the none
# class based library.
